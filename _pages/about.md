I am a Ph.D. student working with Professor Narges Mahyar on Digital Civics. My research interests include bridging the gap between civic leaders and the community members by developing intuitive technology applying visualization and machine learning. I am also exploring affective computing to enable natural communication between humans and machines. I have both teaching (4 years) and industry (2 years) experience with skills in Python, C#, C++, and JavaScript. I am currently looking for internship opportunities in HCI, Affective Computing and Information Visualization.
