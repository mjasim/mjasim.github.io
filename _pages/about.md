I am a Ph.D. student working with Professor [Narges Mahyar](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/mahyar-narges). My research interests include bridging the gap between decision-makers and the data providers by developing interactive technologies using information visualization, human computer interaction, and machine learning. <b>I am currently looking for internship opportunities in HCI and information visualization.<b>
